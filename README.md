### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Cristian OrdoÃ±ez

I work on solving engineering problems by developing, optimizing, and implementing Digital Image Processing techniques. Primarily, I specialize in two major fields: object detection/tracking and embedded systems development.

In this repository, I showcase some of the projects I've been working on throughout my career as a researcher. Honestly, I would like to reprogram all the projects I developed since most of them reflect a different programming style I had at that time. Nevertheless, they still serve to demonstrate my work.
