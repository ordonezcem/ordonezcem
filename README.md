### Hi there 👋, I am Cristian Ordoñez

I work on solving engineering problems by developing, optimizing, and implementing Digital Image Processing techniques. Primarily, I specialize in two major fields: object detection/tracking and embedded systems development.

In this repository, I showcase some of the projects I've been working on throughout my career as a researcher. Honestly, I would like to reprogram all the projects I developed since most of them reflect a different programming style I had at that time. Nevertheless, they still serve to demonstrate a part of my work.

## Skills: 
• C
• Python
• Assembler
• C++
• VHDL
• MATLAB, OPENCV
• Computer vision, object tracking, image enhancement, image algorithm optimization
• Embedded systems, ARM microcontrollers (Cortex-M4, Cortex-M7)
• Real-time embedded systems, FreeRTOS, Segger systemview
• Arduino, PIC microcontrollers, FPGAs
• SMT32CubeIDE, Keil, Yakindu
• PCB design, Altium Designer
• Research and education
